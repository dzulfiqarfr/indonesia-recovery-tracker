Hi!

I am Dzulfiqar Fathur Rahman. Currently, I am working as a journalist covering agriculture, investment, trade and whatnot for [The Jakarta Post](https://thejakartapost.com). (But this is a personal website.)

My interest lies in the intersection of economics and politics. I love combining analysis, writing and data visualization.

While my work mostly involves writing (and interviewing), I also write code and make data visualization in statistical programming language `R`. In addition, I use online charting tool [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) to make web-based interactive graphs.

Outside work, I just read books, play Mario Kart, draw or binge watch a series.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach me via frdzulfiqar@gmail.com or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dzulfiqarfr). I would love to have a good chat over a cup of coffee but, given how the pandemic is still playing out, an e-mail conversation will do.
