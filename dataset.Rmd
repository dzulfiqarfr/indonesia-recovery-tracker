The [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-emergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-full-30mar2020.pdf?sfvrsn=6b68bc4a_2) considered the positive rate of 10 percent to be the general benchmark of enough testing to find all cases.
