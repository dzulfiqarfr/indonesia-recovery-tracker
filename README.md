# Tracking Indonesia's recovery from COVID-19 pandemic

This site puts together several indicators to see how the coronavirus pandemic affects Indonesia and track its recovery from the shock.

While the tracker uses interactive charts, it also uses a summary table of some indicators:

Indicators                                   | Latest          | Projection  
-------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -----------------  
GDP (percent change on a year earlier)       | -3.49 (Q3)      | 4.4 (2021)*  
Inflation (percent change on a year earlier) | 1.7 (Dec)       | 2.3 (2021)*  
Unemployment rate (percent)                  | 7.07 (Aug)      | 9.2 (2020)<sup>†</sup>   
Poverty rate (percent)                       | 9.78 (Mar)      | 12.37 (2020)<sup>‡</sup>
