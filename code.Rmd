I make the plots in `R` using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r) via the `plotly` package. Plotly allows its users to modify many features of a plot through the `R` package. However, it is also possible to replicate all the plots on this site through the Chart Studio.

The source code for all the plots are available [here](https://github.com/dzulfiqarfr/indonesia-recovery-tracker/tree/main/script).
