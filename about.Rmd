This website seeks to serve as a sort of tracker on Indonesia’s path to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, this website was called Indonesia COVID-19 Recovery Tracker, which was launched on Nov. 5, 2020.

To see how the pandemic has affected people and businesses and their recovery from the shock, the Indonesia EconRecovery puts together key social and economic indicators such as economic growth, employment, poverty, inflation and community mobility in charts and tables. 

With the recovery hinging on the country’s pandemic handling, this website also adds COVID-19 metrics including vaccinations in a table displayed on the home page.

While this website seeks to give readers a glimpse of what is happening to the economy as the pandemic unfolds, there are delays in reporting and therefore the data may show a lagged observation compared with the present situation. Of all datasets, only the community mobility data from Google gets updated every two or three days.

Since its inception, the main goal of this website remains to provide a tool for those wanting to casually keep tabs on Indonesia’s recovery from the pandemic without getting too caught up in it  or going through the trouble of collecting, cleaning and visualizing the data themselves.

If you find a bug or want to give a suggestion on datasets or features or anything else, you can either [create an issue](https://github.com/dzulfiqarfr/indonesia-recovery-tracker/issues) on the GitHub repository of this website or, preferably, tell the author via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dzulfiqarfr).
